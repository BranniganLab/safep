# Procedure for patching and generating a new replica:
- Open the system in vmd
- Using colvars, measure the distance between the C1 carbons of the lipid to be patched and a lipid on the opposite leaflet.
- Identify the mean and width of that distribution
- Create a harmonic walls restraint that keeps the C1 carbon in the appropriate range.
- Set the upper and lower walls to include ~95% to 99% of the distribution (typically mean +/- 6A)
- Save these as zrestraint.PO[XY].colvars
- Update the prefixes in the do_run script, the relentlessFEP config file (config*.yaml), and the namd  config file. 
- Use mutateResidue and doAlch found in CHARMMformatics/VMD_scripts/patch_script.tcl to generate the input files
- MAKE SURE ALL "prefix" variables match exactly
- [optional] run a five minute test run by altering the slurm submit script inside do_run*.sh
